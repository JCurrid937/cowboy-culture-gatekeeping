      <h2> Origin of Case Study Topic</h2>
      <p> <br> During the summer 2024 semester, I developed this case study for the Texas Christian University (TCU) Master of Liberal Arts course,"Special Problems — Cultural Conflicts Societal Fault Lines taught by Dr. Jean Marie Brown. Dr. Brown asked our class to develop a case study around one of our class readings. I chose to craft my topic around an article that relayed the backlash Beyonce recieved for the release of her 2024 album, "Act II: Cowboy Carter." <a href="https://time.com/6965367/cowboy-carter-black-country-history/">Read the article here.</a>
     <p><br>When Beyoncé dropped her 2024 album Act II: Cowboy Carter, she made history as the first Black woman to top the Billboard Country Albums Chart. But let’s be real—it wasn’t all applause. The release stirred up plenty of controversy and criticism, especially from within the country music world.</p>
     <p><br>Even though the album is a powerful tribute to her Texas roots—complete with Western sounds, themes, and imagery—some folks still insisted it wasn’t “cowboy enough.” That kind of gatekeeping isn’t new for Beyoncé. Back in 2016, she was publicly snubbed by country stars like Alan Jackson and Travis Tritt after performing at the Country Music Association (CMA) Awards. That moment stuck with her and ultimately helped inspire Cowboy Carter.</p>
     <p><br>Beyoncé’s journey through the country genre shines a light on a much bigger issue: who gets to be part of country music and cowboy culture—and who gets shut out. </p>

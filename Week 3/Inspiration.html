      <h2> Origin of Case Study Topic</h2>
      <p> <br> I developed this case study for the Texas Christian University (TCU) Master of Liberal Arts course, "Cultural Conflicts Societal Fault Lines," taught by Dr. Jean Marie Brown during the 2024 summer semester. Dr. Brown asked our class to develop a case study topic around one of our class readings. I chose to craft my case study around an article that related backlash that Beyonce received from the release of her 2024 album,"Act II:Cowboy Carter."<a href="https://time.com/6965367/cowboy-carter-black-country-history/”</a></p>
     <p><br>We shine a spotlight on the rich, often overlooked contributions of Black individuals to both country music and the cowboy way of life—past and present. Through these stories and facts, we reveal a powerful truth: country music and cowboy culture were never built by just one type of person. Instead, they thrive because of a diverse mix of voices, histories, and identities.</p>

      <h2>Case Study Origin</h2>
      </p> I developed this case study while enrolled in the Texas Christian University (TCU) Master of Liberal Arts course, ""
      <p><br>Too often, the image of the cowboy has been narrowly defined—white, male, straight, and tough-as-nails. But the truth is, the real history of the West is far more diverse."Y’all Means All,” is not just a catchy phrase. It is a promise—to honor the past, acknowledge the present, and shape a future that makes space for everyone. It's about pushing past outdated narratives and lifting up voices that have too often been silenced or sidelined.</p>
      <p><br>Preserving the values that make cowboy culture powerful: honesty, toughness, and community is imperative. But those values ring hollow if they don’t extend to everyone. Cowboy culture doesn’t have to lose its grit or glory to grow—it just needs to open the gate a little wider. </p>

        The cowboy culture is often seen as a symbol of rugged individualism and freedom and associated with admirable virtues such as honor, integrity, loyalty, determination, and grit. "Earn your spurs" is just one of several colloquialisms that captures how becoming a hand is a hard-earned privilege. Taking pride in the hard work and merits required to call oneself, "cowboy," is expected. However, cultural identity should not serve as a prerequisite for earning the right to claim this space. A closer examination of a culture based on many positives such as stewardship of the land and animals reveal a darker side of exclusion and gatekeeping.
